### SUMMARY
***
I'm just starting my way into programming and don't have any commercial experience yet. But I'm highly motivated and put a lot of time and efforts into self-education. This process excites me and I often lose track of the time. I'm always enthusiastically looking for solutions on the Internet, while trying to understand them and rewrite myself, instead of blindly copying.

I'm an active and curious listener, adore people who can teach me something new. I quickly adapt to new conditions. In my previous position, I had to change cities and departments several times, and therefore I successfully worked for different teams.

I'm an open-minded, non-conflict person and always try to treat people with respect. That helped me to build strong relationships with my colleagues and customers. Also, I'm able to self-motivate myself and reach my goals patiently and persistently. It applies to all areas of my life, be it a hobby, study, or work.

My goal is to gain enough knowledge to work on real projects as a part of a team and to get an experienced mentor who will help me boost my personal development in the right direction.

```
function isIsogram(str){
	let upperStr = str.toUpperCase();
	for (let i = 0; i < upperStr.length; i++) {
		let char = upperStr[i];
		let pos = i + 1;
		if (upperStr.includes(char, pos)) {
			return false;
		}
